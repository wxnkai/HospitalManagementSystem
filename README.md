## Getting Started

𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭 𝐎𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐞𝐰:
Developed a hospital management system using Java OOP language and JavaFX with Structured Query Language (SQL) statement and JDBC connectivity for database storage.
The Hospital Management System (HMS) is a comprehensive software application designed to streamline and automate the management of a hospital's operations, including doctor, patient records, medical supplies, staff information, lab, and facilities. 
This system offers an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) to enhance user experience and improve efficiency.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Required package:
- javafx: https://openjfx.io/
